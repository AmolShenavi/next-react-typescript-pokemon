        The name Pokémon actually means "pocket monsters" Pikachu, the most
        popular Pokémon and my personal favorite, is an electric Pokémon with
        special attacks such as "Thundershock" and "Lightningbolt." Other
        Pokémon and their attacks include Krabby, a water Pokémon, with a "vise
        grip" attack; Tauros a normal type Pokémon with a "tail whip" attack;
        and Squirtle, also a water type Pokémon, with a "hydro pump" attack .

        Pokémon started as the brainchild of Japanese creator Satoshi Tajiri,
        34, who combined his two childhood passions: monster movies and the
        study of insects to invent Pokémon in 1991" ("Poka" 2/3). There are over
        155 Pokémon to learn about and collect. There are Pokémon trading cards,
        video games (several different versions), and a cartoon series on the
        Kids’ WB television network.
